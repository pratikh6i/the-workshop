# Network Security: Where the Packets Flow

Understanding networking is **fundamental** to security. Today, we'll explore the OSI model, common protocols, and where vulnerabilities typically exist.

## The OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model breaks network communication into 7 layers:

| Layer | Name | Protocols | Security Focus |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|
| 7 | Application | HTTP, DNS, FTP | Input validation, authentication |
| 6 | Presentation | SSL/TLS, JPEG | Encryption, data integrity |
| 5 | Session | NetBIOS, RPC | Session management |
| 4 | Transport | TCP, UDP | Port scanning, firewall rules |
| 3 | Network | IP, ICMP | Routing attacks, IP spoofing |
| 2 | Data Link | Ethernet, ARP | MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping |
| 1 | Physical | Cables, Hubs | Physical access control |

## Common Network Attacks

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
An attacker intercepts communication between two parties:

```
[Alice] ◄──────► [Eve] ◄──────► [Bob]
         Alice thinks she's
         talking to Bob directly
```

### ARP Spoofing
Attackers send fake ARP messages to link their MAC address with a legitimate IP:

```bash
# Using arpspoof (educational purposes only)
# arpspoof -i eth0 -t <target-ip> <gateway-ip>
```

### DNS Poisoning
Corrupting DNS cache to redirect traffic to malicious sites.

## Hands-On: Packet Analysis with tcpdump

Capture and analyze network traffic:

```bash
# Capture 10 packets on interface en0
sudo tcpdump -i en0 -c 10

# Capture HTTP traffic
sudo tcpdump -i en0 port 80 -A

# Save capture to file
sudo tcpdump -i en0 -w capture.pcap
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use **encrypted protocols** (HTTPS, SSH, SFTP)
- Implement **network segmentation**
- Deploy **intrusion detection systems** (IDS)
- Regularly audit firewall rules

## Key Takeaways

- Security must be considered at **every layer**
- Always assume the network is hostile
- Encryption is your friend—use it everywhere
