## 🚧 Status: Initializing
Today is a preparation day. We are setting the stage for one of the most complex fundamental networking labs: **Building a Manual NAT Gateway.**

## 🎯 The Upcoming Challenge
Most cloud engineers rely on "Cloud NAT" (a managed service). But to truly understand how the internet works, we must build it ourselves using raw Linux primitives.

**Tomorrow's Deep Dive will cover:**
1.  **Packet Masquerading:** How to use `iptables` to rewrite Source IP headers so a private server can "borrow" a public identity.
2.  **Kernel Forwarding:** Flipping the bit in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` to turn a server into a router.
3.  **The Route Table:** Manually overriding VPC logic to force traffic through our choke point.

## 🔜 Coming Soon
The full lab walkthrough, including the `iptables` breakdown and the packet flow visualization, will drop tomorrow evening.

*Resting the neural net for a high-performance execution tomorrow.*
