# Welcome to The Workshop

Today marks **Day 1** of your 90-Day Security Odyssey. This isn't just another course—it's a transformation. Over the next 90 days, you'll develop the mindset, skills, and hands-on experience to think like a security professional.

## What You'll Learn

This journey is structured around three core pillars:

1. **Defensive Security** - Protecting systems, networks, and data
2. **Offensive Security** - Understanding attacker techniques and methodologies
3. **Security Operations** - Building and running security programs

## Why 90 Days?

Research shows that it takes approximately 66 days to form a new habit. We've extended this to 90 days to ensure you have time to:

- Build foundational knowledge
- Practice hands-on skills
- Apply concepts to real scenarios
- Reinforce learning through repetition

## Your First Assignment

Before we dive into technical content, let's establish your learning environment:

```bash
# Create your security lab directory
mkdir -p ~/security-lab/{tools,notes,scripts}

# Initialize a git repository for tracking progress
cd ~/security-lab
git init

# Create your first note
echo "# Security Odyssey Journal" > notes/journal.md
echo "## Day 1: $(date)" >> notes/journal.md
```

## Key Takeaways

- Security is a **mindset**, not just a skill set
- Consistency beats intensity—show up every day
- Document everything—your notes are your future reference

**Tomorrow:** We'll explore Threat Modeling and learn to think like an attacker.
