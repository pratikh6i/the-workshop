# Threat Modeling: Think Like an Attacker

Threat modeling is the practice of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Today, we'll learn the **STRIDE** methodology—one of the most widely used frameworks in the industry.

## What is STRIDE?

STRIDE is an acronym developed by Microsoft that categorizes threats into six types:

| Threat | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **S**poofing | Pretending to be someone else | Fake login pages |
| **T**ampering | Modifying data without authorization | SQL injection |
| **R**epudiation | Denying an action took place | Deleting audit logs |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exposing data to unauthorized users | Data breaches |
| **D**enial of Service | Making systems unavailable | DDoS attacks |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access levels | Privilege escalation |

## The Threat Modeling Process

A typical threat modeling session follows these steps:

1. **Identify Assets** - What are you protecting?
2. **Create an Architecture Overview** - How does the system work?
3. **Decompose the Application** - What are the entry points?
4. **Identify Threats** - What could go wrong? (Use STRIDE)
5. **Document and Rate** - How severe is each threat?
6. **Mitigate** - How do we address each threat?

## Practical Exercise

Let's model threats for a simple web application:

```plaintext
┌──────────────┐     HTTPS      ┌──────────────┐
│   Browser    │ ◄────────────► │  Web Server  │
└──────────────┘                └──────────────┘
                                       │
                                       │ SQL
                                       ▼
                                ┌──────────────┐
                                │   Database   │
                                └──────────────┘
```

**Questions to consider:**
- What if someone intercepts the HTTPS traffic?
- What if the database credentials are exposed?
- How do we prevent SQL injection?

## Key Takeaways

- Threat modeling should happen **early** in the development cycle
- No system is 100% secure—prioritize based on risk
- Use frameworks like STRIDE to ensure comprehensive coverage
